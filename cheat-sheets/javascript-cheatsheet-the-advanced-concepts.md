JavaScript Engine {#JavaScriptEngine}
-----------------

A JavaScript engine is a computer program that you give JavaScript code
to and it tells the computer how to execute it. Basically a translator
for the computer between JavaScript and a language that the computer
understands.

But what happens inside of the engine? Well, that depends on the engine.

There are many JavaScript Engines out there and typically they are
created by web browser vendors. All engines are standardized by ECMA
Script or **ES**.

[List of JavaScript
Engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ECMAScript_engines)

![javascript

> **Nifty Snippet**: 2008 was a pivotal moment for JavaScript when
> Google created the Chrome V8 Engine.
>
> The V8 engine is an open source high-performance JavaScript engine,
> written in C++ and used in the Chrome browser and powers Node JS.
>
> The performance outmatched any engine that came before it mainly
> because it combines 2 parts of the engine, the interpreter and the
> compiler. Today, all major engines use this same technique.

The Parser
----------

Parsing is the process of analyzing the source code, checking it for
errors, and breaking it up into parts.

The AST
-------

The parser produces a data structure called the **Abstract Syntax Tree**
or **AST**.

AST is a tree graph of the source code that does not show every detail
of the original syntax, but contains structural or content-related
details. Certain things are implicit in the tree and do not need to be
shown, hence the title abstract.

The Interpreter
---------------

An interpreter directly executes each line of code line by line, without
requiring them to be compiled into a machine language program.

Interpreters can use different strategies to increase performance. They
can parse the source code and execute it immediately, translate it into
more efficient machine code, execute precompiled code made by a
compiler, or some combination of these.

In the V8 engine, the interpreter outputs bytecode.

> **Nifty Snippet**: The first JavaScript engine was written by Brendan
> Eich, the creator of JavaScript, in 1995 for the Netscape navigator
> web browser. Originally, the JavaScript engine only consisted of an
> interpreter. This later evolved into the SpiderMonkey engine, still
> used by the Firefox browser.

The Compiler
------------

The compiler works ahead of time to convert instructions into a
machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed
by a computer. It runs all of the code and tries to figure out what the
code does and then compiles it down into another language that is easier
for the computer to read.

Have you heard of Babel or TypeScript?

They are heavily used in the Javascript ecosystem and you should now
have a good idea of what they are.

**Babel** is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and
returns browser compatible JS (older JS code).

**Typescript** is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to
Javascript. Both of these do exactly what compilers do. Take one
language and convert into a different one!

The Combo
---------

In modern engines, the interpreter starts reading the code line by line
while the **profiler** watches for frequently used code and flags then
passes is to the compiler to be optimized.

In the end, the JavaScript engine takes the bytecode the interpreter
outputs and mixes in the optimized code the compiler outputs and then
gives that to the computer. This is called \"Just in Time\" or **JIT**
Compiler.

> **Nifty Snippet**: Back in 1995 we had no standard between the
> browsers for compiling JavaScript. Compiling code on the browser or
> even ahead of time was not feasible because all the browsers were
> competing against each other and could not agree on an executable
> format.
>
> Even now, different browsers have different approaches on doing
> things. Enter **WebAssembly** a standard for binary instruction
> (executible) format. [Keep your eye on
> WebAssembly](/courses/learn-webassembly) to help standardize browsers
> abilities to exectute JavaScript in the future!

Writing Optimized Code {#writing-optimized-code}
----------------------

We want to write code that helps the compiler make its optimizations,
not work against it making the engine slower.

### Memoization {#Memoization}

Memoization is a way to cache a return value of a function based on its
parameters. This makes the function that takes a long time run much
faster after one execution. If the parameter changes, it will still have
to reevaluate the function.


``` 
// Bad Way
function addTo80(n) {
  console.log('long time...')
  return n + 80
}

addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)

// long time... 85
// long time... 85
// long time... 85

// Memoized Way
functions memoizedAddTo80() {
  let cache = {}
  return function(n) { // closure to access cache obj
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n]
    } else {
      console.log('long time...')
      cache[n] = n + 80
      return cache[n]
    }
  }
}
const memoized = memoizedAddTo80()

console.log('1.', memoized(5))
console.log('2.', memoized(5))
console.log('3.', memoized(5))
console.log('4.', memoized(10))

// long time...
// 1. 85
// 2. 85
// 3. 85
// long time...
// 4. 90
```

Here are a few things you should avoid when writing your code if
possible:

-   eval()
-   arguments
-   for in
-   with
-   delete

There are a few main reasons these should be avoided.

-   [JavaScript Hidden Classes and Inline Caching in
    V8](https://richardartoul.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/04/26/hidden-classes.html)
-   [Managing
    Arguments](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird/wiki/Optimization-killers#3-managing-arguments)

### Inline Caching


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function findUser(user) {
  return `found ${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
}

const userData = {
  firstName: 'Brittney',
  lastName: 'Postma
}

findUser(userData)

// if this findUser(userData) is called multiple times,
// then it will be optimized (inline cached) to just be 'found Brittney Postma'
```

If this code gets optimized to return only 1 name, then the computer
would have to do a lot more work if you needed to return a different
user.

### Hidden Classes


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function Animal(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}

const obj1 = new Animal(1, 2);
const obj2 = new Animal(3, 4);

obj1.a = 30;
obj1.b = 100;
obj2.b = 30;
obj2.a = 100;

delete obj1.x = 30;
```

By setting these values in a different order than they were
instantiated, we are making the compiler slower because of **hidden
classes**.

Hidden classes are what the compiler uses under the hood to say that
these 2 objects have the same properties.

If values are introduced in a different order than it was set up in, the
compiler can get confused and think they don\'t have a shared hidden
class, they are 2 different things, and will slow down the computation.

Also, the reason the delete keyword shouldn\'t be used is because it
would change the hidden class.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// This is the more optimized version of the code.

function Animal(x, y) {
  // instantiating a and b in the constructor
  this.a = x;
  this.b = y;
}

const obj1 = new Animal(1, 2);
const obj2 = new Animal(3, 4);

// and setting the values in order
obj1.a = 30;
obj1.b = 100;
obj2.a = 30;
obj2.b = 100;
```

### Managing Arguments

There are many ways using **arguments** that can cause a function to be
unoptimizable. Be very careful when using arguments and remember:

#### Safe Ways to Use **Arguments**

-   arguments.length
-   arguments\[i\] when i is a valid integer
-   NEVER use arguments directly without .length or \[i\]
-   STRICTLY fn.apply(y, arguments) is ok

Call Stack and Memory Heap {#call-stack-memory-heap}
--------------------------

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but 2 of the biggest
jobs are reading and executing it. We need a place to store and write
our data and a place to keep track line by line of what\'s executing.

That\'s where the **call stack** and the **memory heap** come in.

### Memory Heap

The memory heap is a place to store and write information so that we can
use our memory appropriately. It is a place to allocate, use, and remove
memory as needed. Think of it as a storage room of boxes that are
unordered.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// tell the memory heap to allocate memory for a number
const number = 11;
// allocate memory for a string
const string = "some text";
// allocate memory for an object and it's values
const person = {
  first: "Brittney",
  last: "Postma"
};
```

![](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/1t2PHBUdARJ5JwqjBa71PS/445937f91389b25c53df8128604a8246/memory-stack.png?w=145)

### Call Stack

The call stack keeps track of where we are in the code, so we can run
the program in order.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function subtractTwo(num) {
  return num - 2;
}

function calculate() {
  const sumTotal = 4 + 5;
  return subtractTwo(sumTotal);
}
debugger;
calculate();
```

Things are placed into the call stack on top and removed as they are
finished. It runs in a first in last out mode. Each call stack can point
to a location inside the memory heap. In the above snippet the call
stack looks like this.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
anonymous; // file is being ran
// CALL STACK

// hits debugger and stops the file
// step through each line

calculate(
  // steps through calculate() sumTotal = 9
  anonymous
);
// CALL STACK

// steps into subtractTwo(sumTotal) num = 9

subtractTwo; // returns 9 - 2
calculate(anonymous);
// CALL STACK

// subtractTwo() has finished and has been removed

calculate(
  // returns 7
  anonymous
)(
  // CALL STACK

  // calculate() has finished and has been removed

  anonymous
);
// CALL STACK

// and finally the file is finished and is removed

// CALL STACK
```

Stack Overflow {#stack-overflow}
--------------

So what happens if you keep calling functions that are nested inside
each other? When this happens it\'s called a \*\*stack overflow\*\*.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// When a function calls itself,
// it is called RECURSION
function inception() {
  inception();
}

inception();
// returns Uncaught RangeError:
// Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

### Garbage Collection

JavaScript is a garbage collected language. If you allocate memory
inside of a function, JavaScript will automatically remove it from the
memory heap when the function is done being called.

However, that does not mean you can forget about **memory leaks**. No
system is perfect, so it is important to always remember memory
management.

JavaScript completes garbage collection with a **mark and sweep**
method.

[Mark and Sweep
Method](https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/garbage-collection-in-redux-applications)

![](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/2lZxKSJGcJZxwRV4yLAIRn/f202496517023cede82dd7b4d7738ccd/mark_and_sweep.gif)


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
var person = {
  first: "Brittney",
  last: "Postma"
};

person = "Brittney Postma";
```

In the example above a **memory leak** is created. By changing the
variable person from an object to a string, it leaves the values of
first and last in the memory heap and does not remove it.

This can be avoided by trying to keep variables out of the global
namespace, only instantiate variables inside of functions when possible.

JavaScript is a **single threaded** language, meaning only one thing can
be executed at a time. It only has one call stack and therefore it is a
**synchronous** language.

### Synchronous {#syncronous}

So, what is the issue with being a single threaded language?

Lets\'s start from the beginning. When you visit a web page, you run a
browser to do so (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Each browser has its
own version of **JavaScript Runtime** with a set of **Web API\'s**,
methods that developers can access from the window object.

In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time. Imagine
an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the
page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that
took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would
have a pretty bad user experience.

This is where **concurrency** and the **event loop** come in.

### Event Loop and Callback Queue {#event-loop-callback-queue}

When you run some JavaScript code in a browser, the engine starts to
parse the code. Each line is executed and popped on and off the call
stack.

But, what about Web API\'s?

Web API\'s are not something JavaScript recognizes, so the parser knows
to pass it off to the browser for it to handle. When the browser has
finished running its method, it puts what is needed to be ran by
JavaScript into the **callback queue**.

The callback queue cannot be ran until the call stack is completely
empty. So, the **event loop** is constantly checking the call stack to
see if it is empty so that it can add anything in the callback queue
back into the call stack. And finally, once it is back in the call
stack, it is ran and then popped off the stack.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
console.log("1");
// goes on call stack and runs 1
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2"), 1000;
});
// gets sent to web api
// web api waits 1 sec, runs and sends to callback queue
// the javascript engine keeps going
console.log("3");
// goes on call stack and runs 3
// event loop keeps checking and see call stack is empty
// event loop sends calback queue into call stack
// 2 is now ran

// 1
// 3
// 2

// Example with 0 second timeout

console.log("1");
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2"), 0;
});
console.log("3");

// 1
// 3
// 2

// Still has the same output
```

In the last example, we get the same output. How does this work if it
waits 0 seconds?

The JavaScript engine will still send off the setTimeout() to the Web
API to be ran and it will then go into the callback queue and wait until
the call stack is empty to be ran. So, we end up with the exact same end
point.

[**2020 Update = Deno**](https://deno.land)

{.custom-container}

The very same Ryan Dahl then gave a talk back in 2018, [10 Things I
Regret About Node.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA) which
led to the recent release of his new (and improved) JavaScript and
TypeScript called [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) which aims to
provide a productive and secure scripting environment for the modern
programmer. It is built on top of V8, Rust, and TypeScript.

If you\'re interested in learning Deno, Zero To Mastery instructors,
[Andrei Neagoie](/about/instructor/andrei-neagoie) and [Adam
Odziemkowski](/about/instructor/adam-odziemkowski) (also an official
Deno contributor), released the very [first comprehensive Deno
course](/courses/learn-deno/).

### Job Queue

The job queue or microtask queue came about with promises in ES6. With
promises we needed another callback queue that would give higher
priority to promise calls. The JavaScript engine is going to check the
job queue before the callback queue.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// 1 Callback Queue ~ Task Queue
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("1", "is the loneliest number");
}, 0);
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("2", "can be as bad as one");
}, 10);

// 2 Job Queue ~ Microtask Queue
Promise.resolve("hi").then(data => console.log("2", data));

// 3
console.log("3", "is a crowd");

// 3 is a crowd
// 2 hi
// undefined Promise resolved
// 1 is the loneliest number
// 2 can be as bad as one
```

### 3 Ways to Promise {#3-ways-to-promise}

There are 3 ways you could want promises to resolve, parallel (all
together), sequential (1 after another), or a race (doesn\'t matter who
wins).


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const promisify = (item, delay) =>
  new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(item), delay));

const a = () => promisify("a", 100);
const b = () => promisify("b", 5000);
const c = () => promisify("c", 3000);

async function parallel() {
  const promises = [a(), b(), c()];
  const [output1, output2, output3] = await Promise.all(promises);
  return `parallel is done: ${output1} ${output2} ${output3}`;
}

async function sequence() {
  const output1 = await a();
  const output2 = await b();
  const output3 = await c();
  return `sequence is done: ${output1} ${output2} ${output3}`;
}

async function race() {
  const promises = [a(), b(), c()];
  const output1 = await Promise.race(promises);
  return `race is done: ${output1}`;
}

sequence().then(console.log);
parallel().then(console.log);
race().then(console.log);

// race is done: a
// parallel is done: a b c
// sequence is done: a b c
```

### Threads, Concurrency, and Parallelism {#threads-concurrency-parallelism}

Even though JavaScript is a single threaded language, there are worker
threads that work in the background that don\'t block the main thread.

Just like a browser creates a new thread when you open a new tab. The
workers work through messages being sent, but don\'t have access to the
full program.

    Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)

-   [Multi
    threading](https://www.internalpointers.com/post/gentle-introduction-multithreading)


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
var worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.postMessage("Helloooo");

addEventListener("message");
```

Execution Context {#execution-context}
-----------------

Code in JavaScript is always run inside a type of **execution context**.
Execution context is simply the environment within which your code is
ran.

There are 2 types of execution context in JavaScript, global or
function.

There are 2 stages as well to each context, the creation and executing
phase.

As the JavaScript engine starts to read your code, it creates something
called the **Global Execution Context**.

### Global Execution Context

**Creation Phase**

1.  global object created
2.  initializes *this* keyword to global

**Executing Phase** 3. Variable Environment created - *memory space for
var variables and functions created* 4. initializes all variables to
*undefined* (also known as **hoisting**) and places them with any
functions into memory


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
this;
window;
this === window;

// Window {...}
// Window {...}
// true
```

### Function Execution Context {#Function-execution-context}

Only when a function is invoked, does a function execution context get
created.

#### Creation Phase

1.  argument object created with any arguments
2.  initializes *this* keyword to point called or to the global object
    if not specified

#### Executing Phase

3.  Variable Environment created - *memory space for variable and
    functions created*
4.  initializes all variables to *undefined* and places them into memory
    with any new functions


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// Function Execution Context creates arguments object and points 'this' to the function
function showArgs(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
  return `argument 1 is: ${arg1} and argument 2 is: ${arg2}`;
}

showArgs("hello", "world");

// arguments: { 0: 'hello', 1: 'world' }
// argument 1 is hello and argument 2 is world

function noArgs() {
  console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
}

noArgs();

// arguments: {}
// even though there are no arguments, the object is still created
```

The keyword arguments can be dangerous to use in your code as is. In
ES6, a few methods were introduced that can help better use arguments.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function showArgs(arg1, arg2) {
  console.log("arguments: ", arguments);
  console.log(Array.from(arguments));
}

showArgs("hello", "world");

// arguments: { 0: 'hello', 1: 'world' }
// [ 'hello', 'world' ]

Hoisting {#hoisting}
--------

Hoisting is the process of putting all variable and function
declarations into memory during the compile phase.

In JavaScript, functions are fully hoisted, var variables are hoisted
and initialized to undefined, and let and const variables are hoisted
but not initialized a value.

Var variables are given a memory allocation and initialized a value of
undefined until they are set to a value in line. So if a var variable is
used in the code before it is initialized, then it will return
undefined.

However, a function can be called from anywhere in the code base because
it is fully hoisted. If let and const are used before they are declared,
then they will throw a reference error because they have not yet been
initialized.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// function expression gets hoisted as undefined
var sing = function() {
  console.log("uhhhh la la la");
};
// function declaration gets fully hoisted
function sing2() {
  console.log("ohhhh la la la");
}
```

\


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// function declaration gets hoisted
function a() {
  console.log("hi");
}

// function declaration get rewritten in memory
function a() {
  console.log("bye");
}

console.log(a());
// bye
```

\


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// variable declaration gets hoisted as undefined
var favoriteFood = "grapes";

// function expression gets hoisted as undefined
var foodThoughts = function() {
  // new execution context created favoriteFood = undefined
  console.log(`Original favorite food: ${favoriteFood}`);

  // variable declaration gets hoisted as undefined
  var favoriteFood = "sushi";

  console.log(`New favorite food: ${favoriteFood}`);
};

foodThoughts();
```

#### Takeaway

> Avoid hoisting when possible. It can cause memory leaks and hard to
> catch bugs in your code. Use **let** and **const** as your go to
> variables.

Lexical Environment {#lexical-enviornment}
-------------------

A **lexical environment** is basically the *scope* or environment the
engine is currently reading code in.

A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used,
even nested brackets {{\...}} create a new lexical environment.

The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is
currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available
variables.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function one() {
  var isValid = true; // local env
  two(); // new execution context
}

function two() {
  var isValid; // undefined
}

var isValid = false; // global
one();

/* 
   two() isValid = undefined
   one() isValid = true
   global() isValid = false
   ------------------------
   call stack
*/
```

Scope Chain {#scope-chain}
-----------

![scope
graph](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/orTo9ia4TX3L5lXsW66rQ/575a4a80639a05791175fbfbd6af5826/scope_graph.png)

Each environment context that is created has a link outside of its
lexical environment called the scope chain. The scope chain gives us
access to variables in the parent environment.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
var x = "x";

function findName() {
  console.log(x);
  var b = "b";
  return printName();
}

function printName() {
  var c = "c";
  return "Brittney Postma";
}

function sayMyName() {
  var a = "a";
  return findName();
}

sayMyName();

// sayMyName runs a = 'a'
// findName runs
// x
// b = 'b'
// printName runs c = 'c'
// Brittney Postma
```

In this example, all the functions have access to the global variable
**x**, but trying to access a variable from another function would
return an error. The example below will show how the scope chain links
each function.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function sayMyName() {
  var a = "a";
  console.log(b, c); // returns error
  return function findName() {
    var b = "b";
    console.log(a); // a
    console.log(c); // returns error
    return function printName() {
      var c = "c";
      console.log(a, b); // a, b
    };
  };
}

sayMyName()()(); //each function is returned and has to be called
```

In this example, you can see that the functions only get access to the
variables in their parent container, not a child. The scope chain only
links down the call stack, so you almost have to think of it in reverse.
It goes up to the parent, but down the call stack.

chain](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/27194kxKraYM8yY7uwam8P/e087dd81d84e5788296d9a4a9e41253e/scope_chain.png)

### JavaScript is Weird


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// It asks global scope for height.
// Global scope says: ummm... no but here I just created it for you.
// We call this leakage of global variables.
// Adding 'use strict' to the file prevents this and causes an error.
function weird() {
  height = 50;
}

var heyhey = function doodle() {
  // code here
};

heyhey();
doodle(); // Error! because it is enclosed in its own scope.
```

Function and Block Scope {#function-block-scope}
------------------------

Most programming languages are block scoped, meaning every time you see
a new { } (curly braces) is a new lexical environment.

However, JavaScript is function scoped, meaning it only creates a new
local environment if it sees the keyword function on the global scope.

To give us access to block scope, in ES6 *let* and *const* were added to
the language. Using these can prevent memory leaks, but there is still
an argument to be made for using *var*.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
//Function Scope
function loop() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log("final", i); // returns final 5
}

//Block Scope
function loop2() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // can access i here
  }
  console.log("final", i); // returns an error here
}

loop();
/*
  1
  2
  3
  4
  final 5
*/
loop2();
// ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

#### let and const

> Variable declarations with **let** and **const** work differently from
> the **var** variable declaration and I wanted to take a minute to
> explain.
>
> When a lexical scope is entered and the execution context is created,
> the engine allocates memory for any *var* variable in that scope and

>
> The **let** and **const** variables only get initialized on the line
> they are executed on and only get allocated undefined if there is no
> assignment to the variable. Trying to access a **let** or **const**
> variable before it is declared or outside of its block without
> returning it will result in a Reference Error.

IIFE - Immediately Invoked Function Expression {#immediately-invoked-function-expression}
----------------------------------------------

Immediately Invoked Function Expression or more simply **IIFE** is a
JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. Can also be
referred to as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// Grouping Operator () creates a lexical scope
(function() {
  // statements
})();
// Immediately invokes the function with 2nd set of ()
```

**Takeaway**: Avoid polluting the global namespace or scope when
possible.

Here we are\... The moment has arrived, time to talk about **this**.

What is **this**?

Why is **this** so confusing?

For some, **this** is the scariest part of JavaScript. Well, hopefully
we can clear some things up.

> **this** is the ***object*** that the ***function*** is a property of

There that\'s simple right? Well, maybe not, what does that mean?

Back in Execution Context, we talked about how the JavaScript engine
creates the global execution context and initializes *this* to the
global window object.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
this; // Window {...}
window; // Window {...}
this === window; // true

function a() {
  console.log(this);
}

a();

// Window {...}
```

In the example above, it is easy to understand that *this* is equal to
the window object, but what about inside of function a?

Well, what object is function a apart of?

In the dev tools, if you expand the window object and scroll down the
list, you will see a() is a method on the window object. By calling a(),
you are essentially saying window.a() to the console.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const obj = {
  property: `I'm a property of obj.`,
  method: function() {
    // this refers to the object obj
    console.log(this.property);
  }
};
obj.method();
// I'm a property of obj.
```

**this** refers to whatever is on the left of the . (dot) when calling a
method


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
 // obj is to the left of the dot
 obj.method();
```

Still confused? Try this:


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function whichName() {
  console.log(this.name);
}

var name = "window";

const obj1 = {
  name: "Obj 1",
  whichName
};
const obj2 = {
  name: "Obj 2",
  whichName
};

whichName(); // window
obj1.whichName(); // Obj 1
obj2.whichName(); // Obj 2
```

Another way to look at **this** is to check which object called it.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const a = function() {
  console.log("a", this);
  const b = function() {
    console.log("b", this);
    const c = {
      hi: function() {
        console.log("c", this);
      }
    };
    c.hi(); // new obj c called function
  };
  b(); // ran by a window.a(b())
};
a(); // called by window

// a Window {â€¦}
// b Window {â€¦}
// c {hi: Æ’}
```

Here is **this** 4 ways:

1.  **new keyword binding** - the new keyword changes the meaning of
    this to be the object that is being created.

2.  **implicit binding** - \"this\" refers to the object that is calling
    it. It is implied, without doing anything its just how the language
    works.

3.  **explicit binding** - using the \"bind\" keyword to change the
    meaning of \"this\".

4.  **arrow functions as methods** - \"this\" is lexically scoped,
    refers to it\'s current surroundings and no further. However, if
    \"this\" is inside of a method\'s function, it falls out of scope
    and belongs to the window object. To correct this, you can use a
    higher order function to return an arrow function that calls
    \"this\".


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// new binding
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  console.log(this);
}

const person1 = new Person("person1", 55);
// this = Person { name: 'person1', age: 55 }

//implicit binding
const person = {
  name: "person",
  age: 20,
  hi() {
    console.log("hi " + this);
  }
};

person.hi();
// this = person { name: 'person', age: 20, hi(){...} }

//explicit binding
let name = "Brittney";

const person3 = {
  name: "person3",
  age: 50,
  hi: function() {
    console.log("hi " + this.name);
  }.bind(window)
};

person3.hi();
// hi Brittney
// this = window {...}

// arrow functions inside objects
const person4 = {
  name: "person4",
  age: 40,
  hi: function() {
    var inner = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return inner();
  }
};

person4.hi();
// this = person4 { name: 'person4', age: 40, hi() {...} }
// if either function is changed around, it doesn't work
```

### Lexical vs Dynamic Scope

A big gotcha for a lot of people working with \*this is when a function
is ran inside of another function. It gets a little confusing, but we
can remember who called the function.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const obj = {
  name: "Billy",
  sing() {
    console.log("a", this);
    var anotherFunc = function() {
      console.log("b", this);
    };
    anotherFunc();
  }
};
obj.sing();

// a {name: "Billy", sing: Æ’}
// b Window {â€¦}
```

In the example above, the obj called sing() and then anotherFunc() was
called within the sing() function.

In JavaScript, that function defaults to the Window object. It happens
because everything in JavaScript is lexically scoped except for the
**this** keyword.

It doesn\'t matter where it is written, it matters how it is called.

Changing anotherFunc() instead to an arrow function will fix this
problem, as seen below. Arrow functions do not bind or set their own
context for **this**.

If **this** is used in an arrow function, it is taken from the outside.
Arrow functions also have no **arguments** created as functions do.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const obj = {
  name: "Billy",
  sing() {
    console.log("a", this);
    var anotherFunc = () => {
      console.log("b", this);
    };
    anotherFunc();
  }
};
obj.sing();

// a {name: "Billy", sing: Æ’}
// b {name: "Billy", sing: Æ’}
```

Okay, last example to really solidify our knowledge of **this**.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
var b = {
  name: "jay",
  say() {
    console.log(this);
  }
};

var c = {
  name: "jay",
  say() {
    return function() {
      console.log(this);
    };
  }
};

var d = {
  name: "jay",
  say() {
    return () => console.log(this);
  }
};

b.say(); // b {name: 'jay', say()...}
// b called the function
c.say(); // function() {console.log(this)}
// returned a function that gets called later
c.say()(); // Window {...}
// c.say() gets the function and the Window runs it
d.say(); // () => console.log(this)
// returned the arrow function
d.say()(); // d {name: 'jay', say()...}
// arrow function does not rebind this and inherits this from parent
```

After everything is said and done, using **this** can still be a bit
confusing. If you aren\'t sure what it\'s referencing, just
console.log(this) and see where it\'s pointing.

Call, Apply, Bind {#call-apply-bind}
-----------------

### Call

Call is a method of an object that can substitute a different object
than the one it is written on.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const wizard = {
  name: "Merlin",
  health: 100,
  heal(num1, num2) {
    return (this.health += num1 + num2);
  }
};

const archer = {
  name: "Robin Hood",
  health: 30
};
console.log(archer); // health: 30

wizard.heal.call(archer, 50, 20);

console.log(archer); // health: 100
```

In this example call is used to *borrow* the heal method from the wizard
and is used on the archer (which is actually pointing *this* to archer),
with the optional arguments added.

### Apply

Apply is almost identical to call, except that instead of a comma
separated list of arguments, it takes an array of arguments.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// instead of this
// wizard.heal.call(archer, 50, 20)
// apply looks like this
wizard.heal.apply(archer, [50, 20]);
// this has the same result
```

### Bind

Unlike call and apply, bind does not run the method it is used on, but
rather returns a new function that can then be called later.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
console.log(archer); // health: 30
const healArcher = wizard.heal.bind(archer, 50, 20);
healArcher();
console.log(archer); // health: 100
```

### Currying with bind

Currying is breaking down a function with multiple arguments into one or
more functions that each accept a single argument.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}

let multiplyByTwo = multiply.bind(this, 2);
multiplyByTwo(4); // 8

let multiplyByTen = multiply.bind(this, 10);
multiplyByTen(6); // 60
```

**Exercise**: Find the largest number in an array


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
 const array = [1, 2, 3];

 function getMaxNumber(arr) {
   return Math.max.apply(null, arr);
 }

 getMaxNumber(array); // 3
```

**Exercise 2**: How would you fix this?


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
 const character = {
   name: "Simon",
   getCharacter() {
     return this.name;
   }
 };
 const giveMeTheCharacterNOW = character.getCharacter;

 //How Would you fix this?
 console.log("?", giveMeTheCharacterNOW()); //this should return 'Simon' but doesn't
 // ANSWER
 // change this line
 const giveMeTheCharacterNOW = character.getCharacter.bind(character);
 console.log("?", giveMeTheCharacterNOW()); // ? Simon
```

JavaScript Types {#javaScript-types}

notes, but decided to take a deeper dive into types in JavaScript here.

### Objects in JavaScript {#objects-in-javaScript}

Objects are one of the broadest types in JavaScript, almost
\"everything\" is an object. [MDN Standard built-in
objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects)

-   Booleans can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
-   Numbers can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
-   Strings can be objects (if defined with the new keyword)
-   Dates are always objects
-   Maths are always objects
-   Regular expressions are always objects
-   Arrays are always objects
-   Functions are always objects
-   Objects are always objects

### Primitive vs Non Primitive

**Primitive** - Primitive values are defined by being immutable, they
cannot be altered. The variable assigned to a primitive type may be
reassigned to a new value, but the original value can not be changed in
the same way objects can be modified.

Primitives are **passed by value**, meaning their values are copied and
then placed somewhere else in the memory. They are also compared by
value. There are currently 7 primitive data types in JavaScript.

-   string
-   number
-   bigint
-   boolean
-   null
-   undefined
-   symbol

**Non Primitive** - The only type that leaves us with is *objects*.

Objects are able to be mutated and their properties are **passed by
reference**, meaning their properties are not stored separately in
memory.

A new variable pointing to an object will not create a copy, but
reference the original objects location in memory. Therefore, changing
the 2nd object will also change the first.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// objects are passed by reference
let obj = {
  name: "object 1"
};
let newObj = obj; // points to same place in memory as obj
newObj.name = "newObj"; // modifies the memory
// Since both point to the same place...
console.log(obj); // {name: newObj}
console.log(newObj); // {name: newObj}
// They are both modified.

let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let newArr = arr;
newArr.push(4);
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(newArr); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

There are two ways to get around this, *Object.assign()* or use the
spread operator {\...} to \"spread\" or expand the object into a new
variable. By doing this, it will allow the new variable to be modified
without changing the original. However, these only create a \"shallow
copy\".

**Shallow copy**: Shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. A new
object is created that has an exact copy of the values in the original
object.

If any of the fields of the object are references to other objects, just
the reference addresses are copied i.e., only the memory address is
copied.

**Deep copy**: A deep copy copies all fields, and makes copies of
dynamically allocated memory pointed to by the fields. A deep copy
occurs when an object is copied along with the objects to which it
refers.

Copy](https://we-are.bookmyshow.com/understanding-deep-and-shallow-copy-in-javascript-13438bad941c)


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const originalObj = {
  nested: {
    nestedKey: "nestedValue"
  },
  key: "value"
};
// originalObj points to location 1 in memory
const assignObj = originalObj;
// assignObj will point to 1 in memory
const shallowObj = { ...originalObj };
// shallowObj points to a new location 2, but references location 1 for the nested object
const deepObj = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObj));
// deepObj clones all parts of the object to a new memory address
```

console.log("deepObj: ", deepObj);

/*

                },

assignObj: {nested: {
                nestedKey: "changed value"
                }, 
              key: "changed value"}

### Type Coercion

Type coercion is the process of converting one type of value into
another. There are 3 types of conversion in JavaScript.

-   to string
-   to boolean
-   to number


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
let num = 1;
let str = "1";
num == str; // true
// notice loose equality ==, not ===
// double equals (==) will perform a type conversion
// one or both sides may undergo conversions
// in this case 1 == 1 or '1' == '1' before checking equality
```

> **Strict equals**: The triple equals (===) or strict equality compares
> two values without type coercion. If the values are not the same type,
> then the values are not equal.
>
> This is almost always the right way to check for equality in
> JavaScript, so you don\'t accidentaly coerce a value and end up with a
> bug in your program.
>
> Here is the [MDN Equality
> Comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness)
> page and the [ECMAScript Comparison
> Algorithm](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-11.9.3).

There are several edge cases that you will come in contact with in
JavaScript as well. Check out this [Comparison
Table](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/) if you have
questions about how types are coerced.

### Static vs Dynamic Typed

The major difference between static and dynamic typed languages is when
the types of variables are checked.

**Static typed languages** (Java, C, C++, C\#) are checked during the
compile stage, so all types are known before run-time.

**Dynamic languages** (JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl) are checked
on the fly, during the execution stage.

Also, after dividing the languages into dynamic and static, they are
then divided again into **strong** and **weak** typed.

**Weakly typed** (JavaScript, PHP, C, C++) languages can make type
coercions implicitly.

**Strongly typed** (Python, Ruby, C\#, Java) do not allow conversions
between unrelated types.

![languages](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/4y7zfWwYdUhlsHf37N5udx/86f8c3eefd09952221bf1900ede8e1a5/languages.png)

The 2 Pillars: Closures and Prototypes {#the-2-pillars-closures-prototypes}
--------------------------------------

Closures and Prototypal Inheritance are two things that make JavaScript
special and different from other programming languages.

### Function Constructor

Functions are objects in JavaScript, which is not true for other
languages.

Because of that, they can be called multiple ways, but they can also be
constructors. A **function constructor** creates a new object and
returns it. Every JavaScript function, is actually a function object
itself.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
(function() {}.contructor === Function);
// true

// function constructor
new Function("optionalArguments", "functionBody");

const four = new Function("return four"); // 4
const sum = new Function("x", "y", "return x + y");
console.log(sum(2, 3)); // 5
```

Almost everything in JavaScript can be created with a constructor. Even
basic JavaScript types like numbers and strings can be created using a
constructor.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// examples of constructor functions in JavaScript
const five = new Number(5);
const assignFive = 5;

// this is different than using regular assignment
const newString = new String(`I am a new string`);
const assignString = `I am an assigned string`;

typeof five; // object
typeof assignFive; // number
typeof newString; //object
typeof assignString; // string

five === assignFive; // false
five == assignFive; // true - types are coerced

// Notice how the types are different
// depending on how they are created.

// Arrays, Booleans, Dates, Objects, and Strings
// can be created this way as well.
```

### Prototypal Inheritance

Almost all objects in Javascript pass down properties through a
prototype chain. We call this chain, prototypal inheritance. The child
of the object \"inherits\" properties from its parent.

All objects in JavaScript are descended from the Object constructor
unless deliberately created or altered to not do so. The objects inherit
methods and properties from **Object.prototype**.

The prototype property also has an accessor property called
**\_\_proto\_\_** that creates a link between the current object and
points to the object it was created from, the \"prototype\".


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
Object.prototype.__proto__;
// null

Object.prototype;
{
  __proto__: null;
  // ...more methods and properties
}

Object;
// function Object()
// This is the object constructor function

Object.prototype.constructor;
// function Object()
// Points to the constructor

Object.__proto__;
// function () {...}
// Because it is created with a constructor function
```

### Prototype vs \\\_\\\_proto\\\_\\\_ {#prototype-vs-proto}

Understanding the difference between \_\_proto\_\_ and prototype can be
quite a confusing concept for JavaScript developers.

Every function in JavaScript automatically gets a **prototype** property
when it is created that gives it the call, apply, and bind methods.

It doesn\'t really do anything with regular functions, but in
constructor functions the prototype property allows us to add our own
methods to the objects we create.

The **\_\_proto\_\_** property is what creates the link between
prototype objects, the child inherits properties from the parent through
the prototype chain.

Each time a new object is created in JavaScript, it uses the
\_\_proto\_\_ getter function to use a built in constructor function
based on what is being created.

This could be an Array, Boolean, Date, Number, Object, String, Function,
or RegExp. Each one has their own separate properties and methods that
they inherit from the constructor.

![prototype\_chain.png](https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/4U7Xxx4CIyG6bHmpOp6ujj/00720fdac4cb138ed97e80da74730cd2/prototype_chain.png){width="1205"
height="673"}


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
let newArr = new Array
newArr
/* []
    {
// all array properties and methods
// inherited from Array constructor function.
      length: 0
      prototype: {
        concat, forEach, pop, splice...
        __proto__: Array(0)
        prototype: {
          __proto__: Object
          prototype: {
            __proto__: null
          }
        }
      }
    }
```

### Callable Object

Because functions are objects in JavaScript, this also gives them the
ability to have properties added to them.

This creates a **callable object**, a special object that creates
properties not available on normal objects.

Below is a visualization of how this works under the hood. This code can
not be ran in the console, but it is a representation of how the object
looks.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function say() {
  console.log('say something')
}

say.yell = 'yell something'

// under the hood visual
// will not run or show in console
const funcObj = {
  // name will not exist if anonymous
  name: 'say',
  // code to be ran
  (): console.log('say something')
  // properties get added
  // apply, arguments, bind, call, caller, length, name, toString
  yell: 'yell something',
}

// with an obj
const obj = {
  // nothing gets created
}
```

> }
> a(function () {console.log('a new function')}
> // return functions within another
> function b() {
>   return function c() {console.log('another func')}
> }
> ```
> 
### Higher Order Functions

A Higher Order Function (HOF) is a function that either takes a function
as an argument or returns another function. There are 3 kinds of
functions in JavaScript.

-   function ()
-   function (a,b)
-   function hof() { return function () {} }

Instead of writing multiple functions that do the same thing, remember
DRY (don\'t repeat yourself). Imagine in the example below, if you
separated each code out into individual functions how much more code you
would be writing and how much code would be repeated.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const giveAccessTo = name => `Access granted to ${name}`;

function auth(roleAmt) {
  let array = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < roleAmt; i++) {
    array.push(i);
  }
  return true;
}

function checkPerson(person, fn) {
  if (person.level === "admin") {
    fn(100000);
  } else if (person.level === "user") {
    fn(500000);
  }
  return giveAccessTo(person.name);
}

checkPerson({ level: "admin", name: "Brittney" }, auth);
// "Access granted to Brittney"
```

Take the example below of how you can separate code out and break it
down to make it more reusable.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function multBy(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

// can also be an arrow function
const multiplyBy = a => b => a * b;

const multByTwo = multiplyBy(2);
const multByTen = multiplyBy(10);

multByTwo(4); // 8
multByTen(5); // 50
```

### Closures

Closures allow a function to access variables from an enclosing scope or
environment even after it leaves the scope in which it was declared.

In other words, a closure gives you access to its outer functions scope
from the inner scope. The JavaScript engine will keep variables around
inside functions that have a reference to them, instead of \"sweeping\"
them away after they are popped off the call stack.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function a() {
  let grandpa = 'grandpa'
  return function b() {
    let father = 'father'
    let random = 12345 // not referenced, will get garbage collected
    return function c() {
      let son = 'son'
      return `closure inherited all the scopes: ${grandpa} > ${father} > ${son}`
    }
  }
}

a()()()

// closure inherited all the scopes: grandpa > father > son

const closure = grandma => mother => daughter => return `${grandma} > ${mother} > ${daughter}`

// grandma > mother > daughter
```

**A Fun Example with Closures:**


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
 function callMeMaybe() {
    const callMe = `Hey, I just met you!`
    setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(callMe)
    }, 8640000000);

 callMeMaybe()

 // ONE DAY LATER
 // Hey, I just met you!
```

Do not run this in the console, it takes 1 day to timeout!

Two of the major reasons closures are so beneficial are memory
efficiency and encapsulation.

### Memory Efficient

Using closures makes your code more memory efficient. Take the example
below.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function inefficient(idx) {
  const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill("ðŸ˜„");
  console.log("created!");
  return bigArray[idx];
}

function efficient() {
  const bigArray = new Array(7000).fill("ðŸ˜„");
  console.log("created again!");
  return function(idx) {
    return bigArray[idx];
  };
}

inefficient(688);
inefficient(1000);
inefficient(6500);

const getEfficient = efficient();

efficient(688);
efficient(1000);
efficient(6500);

// created!
// created!
// created!
// created Again!
// 'ðŸ˜„'

// inefficient created the bigArray 3 times
// efficient created the bigArray only once
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation means the restriction of direct access to some of an
object\'s components. It hides as much as possible of an object\'s
internal parts and only exposes the necessary parts to run. Why use
encapsulation?

-   Security - Controlled access
-   Hide Implementation and Expose Behaviours
-   Loose Coupling - Modify the implementation at any time


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const encapsulation = () => {
  let people = [];
  const setName = name => people.push(name);
  const getName = idx => people[idx];
  const rmName = idx => people.splice(idx, 1);
  return {
    setName,
    getName,
    rmName
  };
};
const data = encapsulation();
data.setName("Brittney"); // 0
data.getName(0); // 'Brittney'
data.rmName(0); // ['Brittney']
// you have no access to the array people
// can only change it via methods provided
```

Object Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming
-----------------------------------------------------

There are 2 basic philosophies when it comes to how you structure your
programs, object oriented and functional. Each style has its use in
programming, it is not one over the other, but merely a preference in
style.

### Object Oriented Programming {#object-oriented-programming}

Object Oriented Programming, or OOP, is the idea that all code should be
grouped into \"boxes\" (objects) to make your program easier to read and
understand.

Keeping the data encapsulated helps to keep the program organized. Each
object has a state that defines what it does and methods (functions on
an object) that can use or modify the state.

Considering almost everything in JavaScript is an object, you would
think this would be easy to do.

Say we want to create a game that has lots of characters that all have
different abilities. How would we go about this?


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const elf1 = {
  name: 'Dobby',
  type: 'house',
  weapon: 'cloth',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

const elf2 = {
  name: 'Legolas',
  type: 'high',
  weapon: 'bow',
  say: function() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`
  }
  attack: function() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`
  }
}

elf1.attack()
// attack with cloth
elf2.attack()
// attack with bow
```

### Factory Functions

As you can see, this code is already getting very repetitive and is not
maintainable with only 1 character type.

Imagine adding more characters, things would get out of control quickly.
So, another way to create objects was introduced, **factory functions**.

Factory functions return a new object every time they are ran. This
could improve the code somewhat.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  return {
    name: name,
    type: type,
    weapon: weapon,
    say() {
      return `Hi, my name is ${name}, I am a ${type} elf.`;
    },
    attack() {
      return `${name} attacks with ${weapon}`;
    }
  };
}

const dobby = createElf("Dobby", "house", "cloth");
const legolas = createElf("Legolas", "high", "bow");

dobby.say(); // Hi, my name is Dobby, I am a house elf.
legolas.say(); // Hi, my name is Legolas, I am a high elf.
dobby.attack(); // Dobby attacks with cloth.
legolas.attack(); // Legolas attacks with bow.
```

### Stores

This is a step in the right direction, but if we added more characters,
we would run into some of the same issues again.

Not only is the code not DRY, the attack method is being created and
taking up memory space for every new elf. This is not very efficient.

How do we solve this? Well, we could separate the methods out into a
store.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const elfMethodsStore = {
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  },
  say() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`;
  }
};

function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  return {
    name: name, // old way
    type, // with ES6 assignment, if they are the same name
    weapon
  };
}

// each method has to be assigned to the store method to
// create the __proto__ chain
const dobby = createElf("Dobby", "house", "cloth");
dobby.attack = elfMethodsStore.attack;
dobby.say = elfMethodsStore.say;

const legolas = createElf("Legolas", "high", "bow");
legolas.attack = elfMethodsStore.attack;
legolas.say = elfMethodsStore.say;
```

### Object.create {#object-create}

Having a store saved us some efficiency in memory, but this was a lot of
manual work to assign each method. So, we were given **Object.create**
to help create this chain without having to assign each method.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const elfMethodsStore = {
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  },
  say() {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}, I am a ${this.type} elf.`;
  }
};

function createElf(name, type, weapon) {
  // this creates the __proto__ chain to the store
  let newElf = Object.create(elfMethodsStore);
  console.log(newElf.__proto__); // { attack: [Function], say: [Function] }
  // this assigns all the methods
  newElf.name = name;
  newElf.type = type;
  newElf.weapon = weapon;
  // this returns the new Elf with everything attached
  return newElf;
}

const dobby = createElf("Dobby", "house", "cloth");
const legolas = createElf("Legolas", "high", "bow");
dobby.attack; // attack with cloth
legolas.attack; // attack with bow
```

### Constructor Functions

Using Object.create is true prototypal inheritance, the code is cleaner
and easier to read. However, you will not see this being used in most
programs.

Before Object.create came around, we had the ability to use constructor
functions.

Constructor functions are exactly like the function constructor we
talked about above. The number and string functions were constructed and
invoked with the **new** keyword and they were capitalized.

The **new** keyword actually changes the meaning of **this** for the
constructor function. Without new, this will point to the window object
instead of the object that we just created.

It is best practice to capitalize constructor functions to help us
identify them and know to use the new keyword. Properties added to a
constructor function can only be done using the **this** keyword,
regular variables do not get added to the object.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// constructor functions are typically capitalized
function Elf(name, type, weapon) {
  // not returning anything
  // "constructing" a new elf
  this.name = name;
  this.type = type;
  this.weapon = weapon;
}

// to use a constructor function
// the "new" keyword must be used
const dobby = new Elf("Dobby", "house", "cloth");
const legolas = new Elf("Legolas", "high", "bow");

// To add methods we need to add
Elf.prototype.attack = function() {
  // cannot be an arrow function
  // this would be scoped to the window obj
  return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
};
// This would need to be repeated for each method.

dobby.attack(); // attack with cloth
legolas.attack(); // attack with bow
```

### Class

Confused yet? Prototype is a little weird and hard to read unless you
really understand your prototypal inheritance.

No one really liked using the prototype way of adding methods, so ES6
JavaScript gave us the **class** keyword.

However, classes in JavaScript are not true classes, they are syntactic
sugar. Under the hood, it is still using the old prototype method. They
are in fact just \"special functions\" with one big difference;
functions are hoisted and classes are not. You need to declare your
class before it can be used in your codebase.

Classes also come with a new method, the **constructor** that creates
and instantiates an object created with class. Classes are able to be
extended upon using the **extends** keyword, allowing subclasses to be
created.

If there is a constructor present in the extended class, the **super**
keyword is needed to link the constructor to the base class. You can
check if something is inherited from a class by using the keyword
**instanceof** to compare the new object to the class.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
class Character {
  constructor(name, weapon) {
    this.name = name;
    this.weapon = weapon;
  }
  attack() {
    return `attack with ${this.weapon}`;
  }
}

class Elf extends Character {
  constructor(name, weapon, type) {
    super(name, weapon);
    // pulls in name and weapon from Character
    this.type = type;
  }
}

class Ogre extends Character {
  constructor(name, weapon, color) {
    super(name, weapon);
    this.color = color;
  }
  enrage() {
    return `double attack power`;
  }
}

const legolas = new Elf("Legolas", "high", "bow");
const gruul = new Ogre("Gruul", "club", "gray");

legolas.attack(); // attack with bow
gruul.enrage(); // double attack power
gruul.attack(); // attack with club

legolas instanceof Elf; //true
gruul instanceof Ogre; //true
```

### Private and public fields {#private-public-fields}

Most class based languages have the ability to create either public or
private fields within a class. Adding these to classes in JavaScript is
still an experimental feature in development.

Support in browsers is limited, but can be implemented with systems like
Babel.

**Public declarations** are set above the constructor and can be used
within the class, but do not get added to a new instance.

The **private declarations** are set with the **\#** sign in front of
the variable and are only accessible within that class, they cannot be
accessed or changed from outside.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// public declarations
class Rectangle {
  height = 0;
  width;
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

// private declarations
class Rectangle {
  #height = 0;
  #width;
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.#height = height;
    this.#width = width;
  }
}
```

So, did we obtain perfect object oriented programming?

Well, that is up for debate. It is really up to you the developer to
decide which style of writing you like best. We did learn that object
oriented programming helps make you code more understandable, easy to
extend, easy to maintain, memory efficient, and DRY!

Functional Programming {#functional-programming}
----------------------

Functional programming has the same goals in mind as object oriented
programming, to keep your code understanable, easy to extend, easy to
maintain, memory efficient, and DRY.

Instead of objects, it uses reusable functions to create and act on
data.

Functional programming is based on a separation of concerns similar to
object oriented programming. However, in functional programming, there
is a complete separation between the data and the behaviors of a
program.

There is also an idea that once something is created, it should not be
changed, being **immutable**.

Unlike OOP, shared state is avoided as functional programming works on
the idea of **pure functions**.

### Pure Functions

A **pure function** has no side effects to anything outside of it and
given the same input will always output the same value. They do not
change any data passed into them, but create new data to return without
altering the original.

However, it is not possible to have 100% pure functions. At some point
you need to interact with the dom or fetch an api.

Even *console.log* makes a function unpure because it uses the window
object outside of the function. The fact is a program cannot exist
without side effects.

So, the goal of functional programming is to minimize side effects by
isolating them away from the data. Build lots of very small, reusable
and predictable pure functions that do the following:

-   Complete 1 task per function.
-   Do not mutate state.
-   Do not share state.
-   Be predictable.
-   Be composable, one input and one output.
-   Be pure if possible.
-   Return something.

### Referential transparency

One important concept of functional programming is **referential
transparency**, the ability to replace an expression with the resulting
value without changing the result of the program.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
function a(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

function b(num) {
  return num * 2;
}

b(a(3, 4)); // 14
// a should always return 7
// so it could be changed to
b(7); // 14
// and the output is the same
```

### Idempotence

Idempotence is another important piece of functional programming. It is
the idea that given the same input to a function, you will always return
the same output. The function could be used over and over again and
nothing changes.

This is how you make your code predictable.

### Imperative vs Declarative

\_\_Imperative programming\_\_ tells the computer what to do and how to
complete it.

**Declarative programming** only tells the computer what to do, but not
how to do things.

Humans are declarative by nature, but computers typically need more
imperative type programming.

However, using higher level languages like JavaScript is actually being
less declarative. This is important in function programming because we
want to be more declarative to better understand our code and let the
computer handle the dirty work of figuring out the best way to do
something.

![imperative
code](//images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/5nFLOTAXwQRDSb2WDlJSFN/bb8d98271f6f1e491142d11249557b76/imperative_code.png)


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// more imperative
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// more declarative
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
arr.forEach(item => console.log(item));
```

### Immutability

Immutability is simply not modifying the original data or **state**.
Instead we should create copies of the state inside our functions and
return a new version of the state.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// Bad code
const obj = {name: 'Brittney'}

function clone(obj) {
  return {...obj} // this is pure
}

obj.name = 'Joe' //mutated the state

// Better code
function updateName(obj) {
  const newObj = clone(obj)
  newObj.name = 'Joe'
  return newObj
}

const updatedNameObj = updateName(obj)
console.log(`obj = ${obj}`, `updatedNameObj = ${updatedNameObj})
// obj = {name: 'Brittney'} updatedNameObj = {name: 'Joe'}
```

You may be thinking that this could get really expensive, memory wise,
to just copy code over and over. However, there is something called
**structural sharing** that allows the data to only copy new information
and points to the original state for any commonalities.

![structure
tree](https://images.ctfassets.net/aq13lwl6616q/7hMhPpSyzvev3ERSpooIC3/6e2b4401726e627db5777f1bde116148/structure_tree.png)

### Partial Application

Partial application is expanding on the idea of currying and taking it a
step farther by separating a parameter out. If you have more than 2
arguments in a functions, then you can **bind** one of them to a value
to be used later.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const multiply = (a, b, c) => a * b * c;
const curriedMultiplyBy5 = multiply.bind(null, 5); // this is null

curriedMultiplyBy5(4, 10); // 200
```

### Pipe and Compose

In JavaScript it is best for speed and efficiency to keep functions
small and reusable.

Function composition is the idea that you lay out your functions like a
factory assembly line. The actual functions **pipe()** and **compose()**
don\'t actually exist in JavaScript yet, but there are many libraries
that use them.

You can however create your own versions of them. The **compose()**
function reads the functions from right to left and the **pipe()**
function will read from left to right.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
// create our own COMPOSE function
const compose = (fn1, fn2) => data => fn1(fn2(data));
// create our own PIPE function
const pipe = (fn1, fn2) => data => fn2(fn1(data));
const multiplyBy3 = num => num * 3;
const makePositive = num => Math.abs(num);
// use compose to combine multiple functions
const composeFn = compose(multiplyBy3, makePositive);
const pipeFn = pipe(multiplyBy3, makePositive);
composeFn(-50); // 150
pipeFn(-50); // 150

// essentially we are doing this
// fn1(fn2(fn3(50)))
// compose(fn1, fn2, fn3)(50)
// pipe(fn3, fn2, fn1)(50)
```

### Arity

Arity simply means the number of arguments a function takes. The more
parameters a function has the harder it becomes to break apart and
reuse. Try to stick to only 1 or 2 parameters when writing functions.

### Reviewing Functional Programming

So, is functional programming the answer to everything?

No, but it is great in situations where you have to perform different
operations on the same set of data.

Functional programming just lays the foundation for creating reusable
functions that can be moved around as needed.

For example, it is great in areas of industry and machine learning and
it is even in some front end libraries like React and Redux. Redux
really popularized functional programming for JavaScript developers.

I\'ll leave you with one more example, a basic shopping cart.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const user = {
  name: "Kim",
  active: true,
  cart: [],
  purchases: []
};

const userHistory = [];

function addToCart(user, item) {
  userHistory.push(
    Object.assign({}, user, { cart: user.cart, purchases: user.purchases })
  );
  const updateCart = user.cart.concat(item);
  return Object.assign({}, user, { cart: updateCart });
}

function taxItems(user) {
  userHistory.push(
    Object.assign({}, user, { cart: user.cart, purchases: user.purchases })
  );
  const { cart } = user;
  const taxRate = 1.4;
  const updatedCart = cart.map(item => {
    return {
      name: item.name,
      price: item.price * taxRate
    };
  });
  return Object.assign({}, user, { cart: updatedCart });
}

function buyItems(user) {
  userHistory.push(
    Object.assign({}, user, { cart: user.cart, purchases: user.purchases })
  );
  return Object.assign({}, user, { purchases: user.cart });
}

function emptyCart(user) {
  userHistory.push(
    Object.assign({}, user, { cart: user.cart, purchases: user.purchases })
  );
  return Object.assign({}, user, { cart: [] });
}

function refundItem(user, item) {
  userHistory.push(
    Object.assign({}, user, { cart: user.cart, purchases: user.purchases })
  );
  const { purchases } = user;
  const refundItem = purchases.splice(item);
  return Object.assign({}, user, { purchases: refundItem });
}
const compose = (fn1, fn2) => (...args) => fn1(fn2(...args));

const purchaseItems = (...fns) => fns.reduce(compose);

purchaseItems(
  emptyCart,
  buyItems,
  taxItems,
  addToCart
)(user, { name: "laptop", price: 200 });

refundItem(user, { name: "laptop", price: 200 });

console.log(userHistory);
```

Composition vs Inheritance {#composition-vs-inheritance}
--------------------------

**Composition** is what we just did with FP, creating small reusable
functions to make code modular.

**Inheritance** is what we did with OOP, creating a class and extending
it to subclasses that inherit the properties.

In OOP we create few operations on common data that is stateful with
side effects.

In FP we create many operations on fixed data with pure functions that
don\'t mutate state. There is a big debate over which one is better and
most people believe that composition is better.

### OOP Problems

One of the drawbacks to inheritance is that it is based on the fact that
it won\'t change, we tell it what it is. We create a class and give it
properties and methods that describe the class.

But say, down the road, we need to update that class and add more
functionality. Adding a new method to the base class will create
rippling effects through your entire program.

FP is more declarative, what to do not how, and OOP is more imperative,
what and how to do something. This is the **tight coupling** problem,
things having to depend on one another, which leads to the **fragile
base class** problem, seemingly safe changes cause unforeseen
repercussions.

It is the opposite of small reusable code. Changing one small thing in
either of the class or subclasses could break the program.

Another problem is **hierarchy** where you may need to create a subclass
that can only do 1 part of the class, but instead you get everything
passed down to it.

### Finally

Composition is probably a better tool to use when creating programs
because it creates a more stable environment that is easier to change in
the future.

The key is to decide which structure is better for your project. You can
use ideas from both of these styles to write your code.

React uses OOP in class components to extend inheritance and then uses
FP in the pure components.

Modules in JavaScript {#modules-in-javaScript}
---------------------

Modules are pieces of code, grouped together, that can be combined
together to create an expandable program that can get bigger as it needs
to.

Good modules are self contained and grouped together with their own
specific functionality allowing them to be moved or deleted without
breaking the program.

### Module Patterns

Originally in JavaScript, we had the **module pattern**.

Before block scope came around, there was only global scope and function
scope.

To create this idea of modules, a **module scope** was implemented just
above the function scope. This allowed variables to be shared, by
exporting and importing, between the functions without having to go
through the global scope.

A function as a module is essentially just an immediately invoked
function expression, IIFE.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
var globalScopeVar = "I can be accessed anywhere";

var moduleName = (function(globalScopeVar) {
  // add private variables here
  var privateVar = "I cannot be accessed outside";
  // create the function
  function say(msg1, msg2) {
    var say1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg1.length);
    var say2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg2.length);
    return say1 > say2 ? say1 : say2;
  }
  globalScopeVar = `I don't change the outside scope`;
  // return only what you want the outside to access
  return {
    say: say
  };
})(globalScopeVar);
```

### Issues with Modules

Even though modules help us to contain and organize code, there are
still problems that can arise.

There can be naming conflicts if you don\'t use const to declare the
module. Also, there are dependency issues if scripts are placed in the
wrong order, such as jQuery needing to be called before it can be used.

Because of these problems, people started developing libraries to solve
them. Before ES6 we had 2 ways to implement modules in JavaScript
**CommonJS** and **AMD**.

**CommonJS** - uses the keywords **require** and **exports** to interact
with the module system.

Require is a function used to import from another module and exports is
an object where functions get exported from. These are run synchronously
where we wait on one module to load before another can start and this is
not ideal for browsers.

However, this code may look familiar because NodeJS still uses this
library. There are other packages such as Browserify and webpack that
aid in bundling scripts with CommonJS to be used in the browsers.

**Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)** - as in the name, AMD loads
modules asynchronously.

This was great for browsers early on before packages that bundled code.

*define(\[\'module1\', \'module2\'\], function(module1, module2)
{console.log(module1.setName());});*

The **define** function takes an array of dependency modules that are
loaded in a non-blocking manner in the background.

Once completed, the callback function is then executed. Packages came
out like RequireJS thatimplemented the AMD endpoint and was the main way
people used AMD modules.

### ES6 Modules

After ES6 came out, pretty much everything above was thrown out the
window with 2 new keywords. We can now use the **import** and **export**
keywords in our files to implement modules. This again may look familiar
from popular frameworks like React.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
import module1 from "module1";
import module2 from "module2";

export function name() {}
```

Here is our module code from above in the new ES6 syntax.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const privateVar = "I cannot be accessed outside this file";

export function name(msg1, msg2) {
  const say1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg1.length);
  const say2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg2.length);
  return say1 > say2 ? say1 : say2;
}
```

There are 2 types of exports, named and default. A named export is
imported using curly braces (**{ importFnName }**) and a default
function is added in created like this:


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
import { importFnName } from "./script.js";
// with a default function the {} are not needed
import name from "./script.js";
// both default and named function import
import name, { importFnName } from "./script.js";

export default function name(msg1, msg2) {
  const say1 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg1.length);
  const say2 = Math.floor(Math.random() * msg2.length);
  return say1 > say2 ? say1 : say2;
}
```

Trying to run this in the browser there is still 2 more things that have
to be done.

You have to declare the **type** in the html script tag as **module**
and the file has to be served from a server. You can spin up your own
server with a package like **live-server** on npm.

{.gatsby-highlight data-language="html"}
``` {.language-html .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
<script type="module" src="'./script.js'></script>
```

Error Handling {#error-handling}
--------------

One of the most important things to learn in being a developer is how to
solve errors. Learning to handle errors makes you a better programmer.

Writing your programs you have the ability to use the **throw** keyword
to stop the program and handle an error by using a **try/catch** block
that has an optional **finally** block or the **.catch()** method for
asynchronous code.

Throwing a new error in asynchronous code gets what is called a silent
fail if there is no catch block present.

In synchronous code, if there is no catch statement placed in the code,
the runtime will create *catch: onerror()* and we see the built in
JavaScript error message in red.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
throw new Error();

// synchronous try/catch/finally block
function fail() {
  try {
    console.log("this works");
    throw new Error("oopsie!!!");
  } catch (error) {
    console.log("we have made an oopsie", error);
  } finally {
    console.log("still good");
  }
}

fail();
// this works // because it goes line by line
// we have made an oopsie Error: oopsie at fail
// still good

// asynchronous .catch()
Promise.resolve("asyncfail")
  .then(response => {
    console.log(response);
    return response;
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.log(err);
  });

(async function() {
  try {
    await Promise.resolve("oopsie #1");
    await Promise.reject("oopsie #2");
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
  console.log("is this still good?");
})();

// Promise {} // Promise resolved
// ooopsie #2
// is this still good?
```

Besides the generic **Error** constructor, there are seven other built
in error constructors.

-   **EvalError** - an error with the global function *eval()*.

-   **InternalError** - an error in the JavaScript engine is thrown.
    Usually when something is too large.

-   **RangeError** - an error when a numeric variable or parameter is
    outside of its valid range.

-   **ReferenceError** - an error that occurs when referencing something
    invalid. E.g. When a variable is used before it is declared.

-   **SyntaxError** - an error that occurs in parsing, the engine does
    not understand what is written.

-   **TypeError** - an error when a variable is not the correct type.

-   **URIError** - an error when *encodeURI()* or *decodeURI()* are
    passed invalid parameters.

Errors created using the new keyword come with 3 properties.

1.  **name** - the name of the error.

2.  **message** - the parameter given to the error.

3.  **stack** - the stack trace or callback queue when the error
    occurred that also includes the line and character number where the
    error happened.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const myError = new Error("oopsie");

myError.name; // "Error"
myError.message; // "oopsie"
myError.stack; // "Error: oopsie at <anonymous>:1:17

function a() {
  const b = new Error("uh oh");
  return b;
}

b(); // b().stack
// Error: uh oh
// at a (<anonymous>:2:12)
// at <anonymous>:1:1
```

Because Error is a constructor function, we can use that to extend it
and add to it. You don\'t want to reveal parts of your program by
allowing an error to give the stack trace and other information to
possible bad actors. So, you can customize what you want your errors to
reveal.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
class AuthenticationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message);
    this.name = "AuthenticationError";
    this.message = "authentication problem";
    this.fix = "please log in";
  }
}

const err = new AuthenticationError("oopsie");
err; // authenticationError: "authentication problem" stack trace
err.fix; // please log in
```

The End\... {#the-end}
-----------

This is the \"official\" end of the Advanced JavaScript section, but
Brittney added a small section of her notes on [data structures and
algorithms](/courses/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/) because they
are an important part of developing great programs.

Data Structures & Algorithms {#data-structures-algorithms}
----------------------------

Data structures and algorithms are the fundamentals of every program.

-   Data structures are collections of values
-   Algorithms are the steps we put in place to manipulate the data
    structures

No matter what language you write in, [if you understand these two
things](/courses/learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/), you have the
ability to write great programs.

### Data Structures

A data structure is different types of containers that hold your data.
Each container has its own type of data it holds and is specfic to that
type. You want to be able to easily access your data and know where it
is located.

It is basically a way to organize your data.

There are two parts to data structures: how to build one and how to use
it.

### How do computers work?

A computer has many parts but 3 that run almost all of our everyday
operations, the CPU, RAM, and a hard drive (storage).

The CPU processes all the data and only has so much power, the RAM is
memory that is temporarily delegated to programs, and a hard drive is
persistent memory that stays where we put it.

Persistent storage is quiet slow, so we need RAM to use as a temporary
holder for memory. RAM is like a storage shelf of memory addresses that
each contain 8 bits or 1 byte. Each bit is either a 0 or a 1 to indicate
whether it is on or off, 1 for on and 0 for off.

### Popular Data Structures

There are many implementations of data structures out there but there
are only 2 fundamental kinds, array of contiguous memory locations and
linked structures, or you can combine the two.

The most important ones you will run into are arrays, stacks, queues,
linked lists, trees, tries, graphs, and hash tables.

With algorithms there are sorting, dynamic programming, BFS + DFS
(Searching), and recursion.

Each data structure has things they are good at and may be better in
certain situations than others. Below is a list of data structures that
are built into several popular languages. That doesn\'t mean that you
can\'t use other types, you just have to build our own. Such as if
JavaScript doesn\'t have stacks, we can build one.

### Arrays

Arrays order items sequentially with an index. Arrays are probably the
simplest and the most widely used data structure because the are fast
and take up the least amount of space. They also have the least amount
of rules.

Array methods have different time complexities, called Big-Order or
[Big-O notations](https://youtu.be/TUiv2UgDgOQ).

\_O(1) is constant time, meaning the time does not change with the data
input.

The \_O(n) is linear time, meaning time changes or goes up the more
operations that need to be performed.

\_O(1) can end up as \_O(n) in languages like JavaScript if it needs to
allocate more memory for the array.

There is also, Big-Omega or Big-Î© notation that give the best possible
time for your program. If a program has the same time complexity in
Big-O and in Big-Î©, then you can use Î¸ as shorthand for both combined.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
const strings = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];
// 4 * 4 = 16 bytes of storage

strings[2]; // c // O(1)
strings.push("e"); // O(1)
// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
strings.pop(); // O(1)
// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
strings.unshift("z"); // O(n)
// ['z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
// unshift took 5 operations to complete.
// ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
// [ 0    1    2    3 ] all indexes need to shift
// ['z', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
// [      0    1    2    3 ]
// [ 0    1    2    3    4 ]
```

### Implementing an Array

Arrays can be declared easily in JavaScript, but what if we built our
own\...


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
class MyArray {
  constructor() {
    this.length = 0;
    this.data = {};
  }
  get(index) {
    return this.data[index];
  }
  push(item) {
    this.data[this.length] = item;
    this.length++;
    return this.length;
  }
  pop() {
    const lastItem = this.data[this.length - 1];
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
    return lastItem;
  }
  delete(index) {
    const item = this.data[index];
    this.shiftItems(index);
    return item;
  }
  shiftItems(index) {
    for (let i = index; i < this.length; i++) {
      this.data[i] = this.data[i + 1];
    }
    delete this.data[this.length - 1];
    this.length--;
  }
}

const newArray = new MyArray();
newArray.push("hi");
// MyArray { length: 1, data: { 0: 'hi'}}
newArray.pop();
// MyArray { length: 0, data: { }}
```

### Hash tables

Different languages have different names for a hash table, but in
JavaScript a hash table is an object. A data structure that stores data
in key/value pairs.

### Hash function {#hash-functions}

A hash function takes a key and maps it to a value of fixed length for
every input.

It is an indempotent function meaning given the same input the output
will always be the same.

A hash table uses the hash function to compute the key into a hash code
and map that to an address in memory where it is stored with the value
in a **bucket**.

Using the hashing technique makes looking up data inside the hash table
very fast and is usually *O(1)* time.


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
let character = {
  age: 20,
  name: "Harry Potter",
  muggle: false,
  patronus: function() {
    console.log("Expecto Patronum!");
  }
};

character.age; // 20 // O(1)
character.levitate = "Wingardium Leviosa!"; // O(1)
character.patronus(); // Expecto Patronum! // O(1)
```

### Hash Collisions

Every data structure is going to come with downsides. Hash collisions
are what happens when a hash function maps a key to the same address as
a previously added key.

With enough data and limited memory, we will always run into this
collision. This does not overwrite the previous information, but creates
a linked list and slows down our ability to access the information.

Your big O notation time jumps from O(1) to O(n/k) where n is the time
and k is the size of the hash table.

### Hashing in JavaScript

JavaScript came out with 2 ways to help prevent hash collisions when
implenting hash tables, the **Map** object and the **Set**.

Map will store key/value pairs like an object, but will remember the
original order in memory. A Map also allows for any data type to be
stored as a key such as an array or function.

A Set will only store the values and also remembers the original order,
but the values may only occur once.

### Create a Hash Table


``` {.language-javascript .line-numbers style="counter-reset: linenumber NaN"}
class HashTable {
  constructor(size) {
    this.data = new Array(size);
    // this.data = [];
  }

  _hash(key) {
    let hash = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < key.length; i++) {
      hash = (hash + key.charCodeAt(i) * i) % this.data.length;
    }
    return hash;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    let address = this._hash(key);
    if (!this.data[address]) {
      this.data[address] = [];
    }
    this.data[address].push([key, value]);
    return this.data;
  }

  get(key) {
    const address = this._hash(key);
    const currentBucket = this.data[address];
    if (currentBucket) {
      for (let i = 0; i < currentBucket.length; i++) {
        if (currentBucket[i][0] === key) {
          return currentBucket[i][1];
        }
      }
    }
    return undefined;
  }

  keys() {
    const keysArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < this.data.length; i++) {
      if (this.data[i]) {
        keysArray.push(this.data[i][0][0]);
      }
    }
    return keysArray;
  }
}

const myHashTable = new HashTable(50);
myHashTable.set("grapes", 10000);
myHashTable.get("grapes");
myHashTable.set("apples", 9);
myHashTable.get("apples");
myHashTable.keys();
```
