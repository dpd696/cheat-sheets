Running Node.js {#running-node-js}
---------------

For running Node.js:

  Command            Comments
  ------------------ --------------------------------------
  node               Run the Node REPL in your terminal
  node ---version    Print your current Node version
  node filename.js   Execute the Node code in filename.js

\

> ðŸ’¡ REPL stands for **R**ead **E**val **P**rint **L**oop. This is the
> list of steps that happen when you run the `node`{.language-text}
> command and then type some code.

Node.js Global Object {#nodejs-global-object}
---------------------

In Node, we have a `global`{.language-text} object that we can always
access. Features that we expect to be available everywhere live in this
`global`{.language-text} object.

For example, to have some code execute after 5 seconds we can use either
`global.setTimeout`{.language-text} or just
`setTimeout`{.language-text}. The `global`{.language-text} keyword is
optional.

``` 
setTimeout(() => { 
  console.log('hello');
}, 5000);
```

\
Probably the most famous global is `global.console.log`{.language-text}
which we write as just `console.log`{.language-text}.

Node.js Module System
---------------------

In Node.js, each file is treated as a separate module. Modules provide
us a way of re-using existing code.

### The require Function {#The-require-Function}

We can re-use existing code by using the Node built-in
`require()`{.language-text} function. This function imports code from
another module.

``` 
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFileSync('hello.txt');

// OR...

const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
readFileSync('hello.txt');
```

### Built-in Modules {#Built-in-Modules}

Some modules like fs are built in to Node. These modules contain
Node-specific features.

**Key built-in modules include:**

-   **fs** \-- read and write files on your file system
-   **path** \-- combine paths regardless of which OS you\'re using
-   **process** \-- information about the currently running process,
    e.g. process.argv for arguments passed in or process.env for
    environment variables
-   **http** \-- make requests and create HTTP servers
-   **https** \-- work with secure HTTP servers using SSL/TLS
-   **events** \-- work with the EventEmitter
-   **crypto** \-- cryptography tools like encryption and hashing

### Creating Modules {#Creating-Modules}

We can create our own modules by exporting a function from a file and
importing it in another module.

``` 
// In src/fileModule.js
function read(filename) { }
function write(filename, data) { }

module.exports = {
  read,
  write,
};

// In src/sayHello.js
const { write } = require('./fileModule.js')
write('hello.txt', 'Hello world!');
```

\
Some Node modules may instead use the shorthand syntax to export
functions.

``` 
// In src/fileModule.js
exports.read = function read(filename) { }
exports.write = function write(filename, data) { }
```

### ECMAScript Modules {#ECMAScript-Modules}

The imports above use a syntax known as CommonJS (CJS) modules. Node
treats JavaScript code as CommonJS modules by default. More recently,
you may have seen the ECMAScript module (ESM) syntax. This is the syntax
that is used by TypeScript.

``` 
// In src/fileModule.mjs
function read(filename) { }
function write(filename, data) { }

export {
  read,
  write,
};

// In src/sayHello.mjs
import { write } from './response.mjs';
write('hello.txt', 'Hello world!');
```

We tell Node to treat JavaScript code as an ECMAScript module by using
the .mjs file extension. Pick one approach and use it consistently
throughout your Node project.

Node.js Packages
----------------

Node developers often publicly share *packages*, that other developers
can use to help solve common problems. A package is a collection of Node
modules along with a *package.json* file describing the package.

To work with Node packages we use NPM. NPM includes two things:

1.  The NPM registry with a massive collection of Node packages for us
    to use.
2.  The NPM tool that you installed when you installed Node.

> ðŸ”Ž We can search the NPM registry for packages at
> [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/). The NPM tool will by default
> install packages from this NPM registry.

### NPM Commands {#NPM-Commands}

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command                             Comments
  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------------

                                      by package.json\
                                      Defaults to executing
                                      `node server.js`{.language-text}

  npm init                            Initialize a fresh package.json file

  npm init -y                         Initialize a fresh package.json file,
                                      accepting all default options.\
                                      Equivalent to npm init ---yes

  npm install                         Equivalent to npm i

  npm install \<package\>             Install a package from the NPM registry
                                      at
                                      [www.npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com)\
                                      Equivalent to npm i \<package\>

  npm install -D \<package\>          Install a package as a development
                                      dependency\
                                      Equivalent to npm install ---save-dev
                                      \<package\>

  npm install -g \<package\>          Install a package globally.

  npm update \<package\>              Update an already installed package\
                                      Equivalent to npm up \<package\>

  npm uninstall \<package\>           Uninstall a package from your
                                      node\_modules/ folder\
                                      Equivalent to npm un \<package\>

  npm outdated                        Check for outdated package dependencies

  npm audit                           Check for security vulnerabilities in
                                      package dependencies

  npm audit fix                       Try to fix any security vulnerabilities
                                      by automatically updating vulnerable
                                      packages
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### package.json {#package-json}

Most Node applications we create include a *package.json* file, which
means our Node applications are also Node packages.

**The *package.json* file contains:**

1.  Name, version, description, license of the current package.
2.  Scripts to automate tasks like starting, testing, and installing the
    current package.
3.  Lists of dependencies that are required to be installed by the
    current package.

### node\_modules {#node-modules}

This folder lives next to your package.json file.

When you run `npm install`{.language-text} the packages listed as
dependencies in your package.json are downloaded from the NPM registry
and put in the node\_modules folder.

It contains not just your *direct* *dependencies*, but also the
dependencies of those dependencies. The entire *dependency tree* lives
in node\_modules.

### package-lock.json {#package-lock-json}

The package-lock.json file is automatically created by NPM to track the
exact versions of packages that are installed in your node\_modules
folder. Share your package-lock.json with other developers on your team
to ensure that everyone is running the exact same versions of every
package in the dependency tree.

Node.js Event Emitter {#nodejs-event-emitter}
---------------------

Node.js provides a built-in module to work with events.

``` 
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const celebrity = new EventEmitter();

celebrity.on('success', () => {
  console.log('Congratulations! You are the best!');
});

celebrity.emit('success'); // logs success message
celebrity.emit('success'); // logs success message again
celebrity.emit('failure'); // logs nothing
```

\
Many features of Node are modelled with the EventEmitter class. Some
examples include the currently running Node `process`{.language-text}, a
running HTTP server, and web sockets. They all *emit* events that can
then be listened for using a listener function like
`on()`{.language-text}.

For example, we can listen for the exit event on the current running
process. In this case, the event has a code associated with it to be
more specific about how the process is exiting.

``` 
const process = require('process');

process.on('exit', (code) => {
  console.log(`About to exit with code: ${code}`);
});
```

Backend Concepts {#backend-concepts}
----------------

**Client-server architecture**

Your frontend is usually the client. Your backend is usually the server.

In a client-server architecture, clients get access to data (or
\"resources\") from the server. The client can then display and interact
with this data.

The client and server communicate with each other using the HTTP
protocol.

**API**

Short for Application Programming Interface.

This is the set of functions or operations that your backend server
supports. The frontend interacts with the backend by using only these
operations.

On the web, backend APIs are commonly defined by a list of URLs,
corresponding HTTP methods, and any queries and parameters.

**CRUD**

Short for Create Read Update and Delete.

These are the basic operations that every API supports on collections of
data. Your API will usually save (or \"persist\") these collections of
data in a database.

**RESTful**

RESTful APIs are those that follow certain constraints. These include:

Client-server architecture. Clients get access to resources from the
server using the HTTP protocol.

Stateless communication. Each request contains all the information
required by the server to handle that request. Every request is separate
from every other request.

Cacheable. The stateless communication makes caching easier.

In RESTful APIs each of our CRUD operations corresponds to an HTTP
method.

  CRUD Operation   HTTP method                  Example
  ---------------- ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Create           POST                         **POST /cards** (save a new card to the cards collection)
  Read             GET                          **GET /cards** (get the whole cards collection) *or* **GET /cards/:cardId** (get an individual card)
  Update           PUT (or more rarely PATCH)   **PUT /cards/:cardId** (update an individual card)
  Delete           DELETE                       **DELETE /cards/:cardId** (delete an individual card) *or more rarely* **DELETE /cards** (delete the entire collection of cards)

Express.js
----------

### GET Routes {#GET-Routes}

``` 
// Get a whole collection of JSON objects
app.get("/cards", (req, res) => {
  return res.json(cards);
});

// Get a specific item in a collection by ID
app.get("/cards/:cardId", (req, res) => {
  const cardId = req.params.cardId;
  return res.json(cards[cardId]);
});
```

### POST Routes {#POST-Routes}

``` 
app.post("/cards", (req, res) => {
  // Get body from the request
  const card = req.body;

  // Validate the body
  if (!card.value || !card.suit) {
    return res.status(400).json({
      error: 'Missing required card property',
    });
  }

  // Update your collection
  cards.push(card);

  // Send saved object in the response to verify
  return res.json(card);
});
```

### Routers {#Routers}

``` 
// In src/cards.router.js
const cardsRouter = express.Router();

cardsRouter.get("/", (req, res) => {
  return res.json(cards);
});

cardsRouter.get("/:cardId", (req, res) => {
  const cardId = req.params.cardId;
  return res.json(cards[cardId]);
});

// In src/api.js
const cardsRouter = require('./cards.router');

const api = express.Router();

api.use('/cards', cardsRouter);
```

Node.js Folder Structure {#nodejs-folder-structure}
------------------------

One typical folder structure for an API following RESTful architecture
and using the Express framework can be found below. Node servers
typically follow the Model View Controller pattern. Models live together
in one folder. Controllers are grouped together based on which feature
or collection they are related to. Views are typically managed by the
front end, although some Node servers may serve static HTML or use
templating engines like [Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hbs).

``` 
node-project/                    # top level project
  node_modules/                  # all installed node packages
  data/                          # static data files, if needed
    database.json
  src/                           # the source code for your server
    models/                      # models following the model-view-controller pattern
      comment.model.js
      post.model.js
    routes/                      # one folder for each collection in your API
      feeds/                     # folder for the user feeds collection
        feed.router.js           # router listing all possible routes for user feeds
        feed.controller.js       # controller with the implementation for each route
      posts/
        post.router.js
        post.controller.js
      api.js                     # top level router connecting all the above routes
    services/                    # any long running services or utilities
      mongo.js                   # e.g. connecting to a MongoDB database
    app.js                       # all Express middleware and routers
    server.js                    # the top level Node HTTP server
  .gitignore
  package-lock.json
  package.json
```

This is just a reference. In the real world, every project will have
differences in the requirements and the ideal project structure.

Cross Origin Resource Sharing {#cross-origin-resource-sharing}
-----------------------------

Something *all* web developers soon come across is **Cross Origin
Resource Sharing (CORS)**.

Browsers follow the **Same Origin Policy (SOP)**, which prevents
requests being made across different origins. This is designed to stop
malicious servers from stealing information that doesn\'t belong to
them.

**Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** allows us to allow or whitelist
other origins that we trust, so that we can make requests to servers
that don\'t belong to us. For example, with CORS set up properly,
<https://www.mydomain.com> could make a POST request to
<https://www.yourdomain.com>.

In Express we commonly set up CORS using the following middleware
package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors>.

PM2 Commands {#PM2-commands}
------------

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a tool we use to create and manage
Node.js clusters. It allows us to create clusters of processes, to
manage those processes in production, and to keep our applications
running forever. We can install the PM2 tool globally using
`npm install -g pm2`{.language-text}.

  Command                    Comments
  -------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  pm2 list                   List the status of all processes managed by PM2.
  pm2 start server.js -i 4   Start server.js in cluster mode with 4 processes.
  pm2 start server.js -i 0   Start server.js in cluster mode with the maximum number of processes to take full advantage of your CPU.
  pm2 logs                   Show logs from all processes.
  pm2 logs ---lines 200      Show older logs up to 200 lines long.
  pm2 monit                  Display a real-time dashboard in your terminal with statistics for all processes.
  pm2 stop 0                 Stop running process with ID 0.
  pm2 restart 0              Restart process with ID 0.
  pm2 delete 0               Remove process with ID 0 from PM2\'s list of managed processes.
  pm2 delete all             Remove all processes from PM2\'s list.
  pm2 reload all             Zero downtime reload of all processes managed by PM2. For updating and reloading server code already running in production.
